Good OO techniques with use of the Composite, Decorator, Iterator and Singleton design patterns

System:
Implementing a restaurant's ordering system. This system should allow customers to browse the
menu items, select some of them to create an order, see the full order, and pay it.

The system should include the following details:

- Each item can be either an appetizer, a main course, a dessert, a side, or a drink. Drinks can be
alcoholized or not.
- The list of all available items are stored in a database.
- Purchasing an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert together constitute a full meal, and results in
the dessert being half-priced.
- Each day, a different "Item-of-the-day" appears on the menu. This item is a regular item, but with a
discount for the day.
- When ordering items, the customer should be able to list all items in their order, with their respective
prices, in addition to the total. For Items-of-the-day and full meals, the regular price of the items
should be indicated in addition to the discounted price.
- When ordering at least one alcoholized drink, the system should show a warning, saying that the
customer must be at least 18 years old.
